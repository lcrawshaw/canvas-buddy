## 1. Summary
### Completed

1. **UI Library Selection:** I successfully chose a UI library for the project, which will help me streamline the design process and maintain consistency throughout the application.
2. **Codebase Setup:** I efficiently set up the React codebase for the GUI, laying a solid foundation for the project's development.
3. **File Upload Component:** I created a file upload component that allows users to upload their Canvas quizzes, which is a crucial feature of the project.
4. **Quiz Parsing API:** I built an Express App with a route for parsing quiz logic and added base logic to the API route. This will enable the application to process quiz files and extract relevant information.
5. **Handling Duplicates:** I updated the quiz parsing API to handle duplicate questions, enhancing the application's robustness and reliability.

### To do

1. **Multi-Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Add the ability for users to drag and drop multiple files at once, streamlining the file upload process.
2. **Fix scrollTo Position:** Adjust the scrollTo position by offsetting the navigation height, improving the user experience when navigating through the application.
3. **Scrolling Nav:** Implement a scrolling navigation bar to allow for easy access to different sections of the application as users scroll through the content.
4. **Quiz Parsing API Update:** Modify the quiz parsing API to separate wrong answers into a discrete view, enhancing the readability and organization of quiz data.

## 3. Personal Project Retrospective

### What could have been improved:

1. **Time Management:** I spent more time on certain tasks than initially anticipated, causing delays in the project timeline. In the future, I need to allocate my time more effectively and set realistic expectations for task completion.
2. **Communication:** As a personal project, I didn't involve others in the development process. However, it might be beneficial to seek feedback from peers or potential users to gain valuable insights and identify areas for improvement.

### What I learned:

1. **Estimation:** I realized that my initial estimates for task completion were not always accurate. I need to refine my estimation skills and account for potential roadblocks or unforeseen complexities.
2. **Prioritization:** Focusing on high-priority tasks and breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps was crucial for making steady progress. This approach allowed me to concentrate on essential features and avoid distractions.

### Next Steps:

1. Periodically review progress and reevaluate priorities to ensure that the project remains on track and aligned with its goals.
2. Seek feedback from peers and potential users to validate the project's direction and identify any areas for improvement.

By reflecting on the progress made and lessons learned during this sprint, I can apply these insights to future sprints and continuously improve my project management skills.
